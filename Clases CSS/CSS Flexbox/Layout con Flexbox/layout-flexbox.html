        The results of her alteration is not only within Artoria Alter's interior but also extends to her outward
        appearance. The color of her skin becomes pale, and the pupil of her eyes that were at first concealed behind a
        black visor during the moment of her summoning becomes golden from her original green eye color as well
        Personality
        A different aspect of the King of Knights devoted to cruelty, greatly unlike the case of the normal Artoria. She
        is referred to as Saber Alter.[1] A behavior without futility, a cold-hearted personality that makes Artoria
        seem like a different person, but if one is to carefully come into contact with her, they might notice that what
        lies at the basis is still the same.[2]
        Artoria Alter's personality changes vastly from her normal self upon being corrupted by Angra Mainyu, but she
        cannot be called a villain. She is more of a dark hero who is still an idealist clinging to her own values even
        after being blackened.[6]

        After taking in by the hatred of the curse, Artoria Alter comes to the realization that the duty of a hero is to
        be hated and ostracized, that a hero's only duty is to cut down foes using all their strength. She believes that
        she was prepared for such an outcome upon drawing Caliburn, and decides to entrust her blade to All the World's
        Evils. While she still takes her duty as king seriously, believing it is her obligation to those whose lives
        were lost because of her, she no longer believes in the ideals set for herself and her people. The end was
        concluded long ago, after all her prayers and glory vanished on the hill in Camlann
